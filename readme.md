## Abstract
Nowadays, social networks let the massive diffusion of information. In many cases, this information isn't verified and it could negatively influence our culture and the way we think. In fact, activity of automated accounts has been detected in recent years. There aren't tools which provide analysis accounts considering automation, so, due to difficult detection, is necessary to develop a tool in order to analyze accounts and provide the way to investigate suspicious accounts. Web application has been designed and coded in order to analyze Twitter users’ accounts. It offers a search engine and dashboard in order to display data analyze visually and effectively. For collection data we use Botometer API and Twitter API by Tweepy.
